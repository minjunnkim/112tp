Project Description:
"Complex Beauti.py" (this is the file name and the project name) is a python program that visualizes the Julia set given the c value. This "c" is a complex number of format x + yi. 
Topics relating to Julia sets are taught in Analysis of Complex Kind courses.
The program will have custom input(c) capabilities, zoom in/out, custom colors, custom maximum iteration, custom brightness, custom escape radius,
and a loading screen while the visualization loads.
The following are possible functions to be implemented: animation of a rotation julia set, screenshot capabilities (save to user's computer).

Structural Plan:
The finalized project will be organized in multiple python files, one containing the graphics/animations, in a familiar 
cmu graphics format that we used in our homeworks, and others containing object-oriented programming style class files 
for buttons, pixel-based drawing, and others to refine the UI

Modules used: cmath, math (both built-in, cmath is used only for the complex number format and simple operations such as multiplication)

    -appStarted(app) will contain all of the variables to be used throughout the entire code. Some variables include base color(app.color), zoom (app.zoom), max iteration (app.maxIter), etc.

    -keyPressed and mousePressed will contain the corresponding works for the keys pressed and mouse clicks. For example, a function corresponding to 'j' key is to draw the julia set.

    -isfloat(num) will be used to check if user's input of "c" value is a valid float input. True if it is, False if not.

    -getJuliaSet(app) calculates the julia set. More information is below on algorithmic plan.

    -colorPicker(app, r, g, b, i) will return a (r, g, b) value given the final iteration, i for each pixel on the screen. This will determine the color of the pixel on the screen. 
        -rgbToHex(r, g, b) will convert the given r, g, b value into a hexcode color.

    -redrawAll(app, canvas) and all of the draw functions will be used to draw the main screen, the julia set, and other buttons/texts on the screen. 
        A boolean variable in app will be used to turn on/off these displays.

        -drawLoadingScreen(app, canvas) (in progress, may be removed) will draw a loading screen while the getJuliaSet(app) calculates the julia set. 
            This is so the user has a visual while the long process of calculation goes on. Currently, the visualization takes ~30 seconds on a 480x360 resolution

        -drawJuliaSet(app, canvas) will draw the actual julia set on the screen based on the app.screen dictionary updated from getJuliaSet function above.
            the two functions getJuliaSet(app) and drawJuliaSet(app, canvas) are separated in order to not do the julia set calculation process over and over 
            again while the program runs. (Since draw functions are run over and over as the app runs). Using sets and dictionaries, we maximize the efficiency.
    
Algorithmic Plan:
The most trickiest part of this project is calculating the julia set given c, in the most efficient, yet accurate way possible and interpreting the 
corresponding color, based on the default or user-input color, in the visualization. This calculation also needs to be able to be adjusted by different
user-input values, such as "c", zoom, escape radius, maximum iteration, brightness(not the brightness of the app, 
but this value is used to brighten regions that are not the base color in the visualization)

(Lighter color means that the iteration was closer to maxIter, black means that the iteration went through all maxIter amount of iterations)

The getJuliaSet(app), as of now, will iterate through every pixel in the given range and iterate through a while loop that will run at max maxIter 
many iterations and will stop if the z value exceeds app.escapeRadius ** 2. Based on this i, the iteration stopped at, the color is determined 
thorugh the colorPicker function above. With the color, we put it into a dictionary, app.screen, with color as key and set of pixels as the value 
with a format {color: {pixel}, color2: {pixel1, pixel2, ...}, ...} 

More efficiency procedures are planned to be implemeneted (dynamic programming, etc.) in getJuliaSet(app) function in order to further reduce the runtime

Version Control Plan:
I am using github in order to back up my code. I commit and push after every work session with the commit message as the date. Image is in the zip file.
    
TP2 Update:
Added a recursion method of calculating the julia set. Will add a button to switch between two algorithms.
**The improved original algorithm is significantly faster now, averaging ~1 to 2 seconds on 480x360 from ~45 seconds before.
**Recursion method takes <10 seconds, slightly slower than the modified original algorithm
ColorPicker function was modified. Since we use Image and set the mode to RGB, we do not need rgbtohex conversion.
Also added a complementary color calculation instead of black for the pixels that go through all maxIter iterations.
Arrow button images were added for zoom in/out, move up/down/right/left, increase/decrease max iteration.
A simple button and a separate screen will be added to change color. Users will input rgb code, 
with a color preview before actually updating the color of the fractal. 
A button to switch from recursion/normal

To-do:
Finish class julia.py (for julia sets)
Make class button.py (for buttons)  -- Done
Create better visuals  -- In-Progress
Preset suggestions and guides on the input on the screen
